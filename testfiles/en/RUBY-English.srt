1
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:16,740
 Get up 

2
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:18,580
 breakfast 

3
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,480
 Self-diagnosis: outsider 

4
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:25,780
 Alternatively also "nerd" 

5
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:42,560
 I prefer computers to people. 

6
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:59,100
 Everyone always leaves me alone. 

7
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:08,320
 The teachers too. 

8
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:13,080
 Chapter 1 

9
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,580
 A few weeks ago something unusual happened. 

10
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:24,080
 This boy gave me his cell phone 

11
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,900
 I should fix it. 

12
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:46,600
 Everything went according to plan 

13
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:50,180
 until I tried to import the backup. 

14
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:58,360
 To fix the problem, I wrote my own software. 

15
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:10,300
 It was like an unobserved door that said, "No entry!" That was a crack open. 

16
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,480
 Chapter 2 

17
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:21,580
 I started reading his messages. 

18
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:26,360
 But after a while it got boring. 

19
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:17,240
 But I started to overdo it. 

20
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,560
 Chapter 3 

21
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:41,940
 With one click I was able to destroy relationships and friendships. 

22
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,100
 Chapter 4 

23
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:07,400
 I just felt crappy. I knew I had gone too far. 

24
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,440
 I had nightmares more and more. 

25
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:49,380
 Self-diagnosis: outsider 

26
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:54,120
 But now I know exactly who I am. 

27
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:58,820
 And I want to do it again at any time.
